# BeamTimingAnalysis

## November 1, 2018: Meeting with Henry, Evan, Bernhard, and

Main injector is 7 times the Booster diameter, but only 6 of the 7 slots are taken. This is to give time to fire the kicker.

"Front Porch": acceleration of the beam (takes about a second) (batches are already in the recycler)

* 11 usec kicker time, every 1.2 seconds. Important figure of merit for all experiments.
* Contains 588 bunches (-84), spaced by an RF frequency of 53 MHz
* 500/53MHz give you 10 usec
* There is also slip-stacking (doubling up on the bunches)

(Booster Batch is at 50 MHz, 84 bunches)

On average the RMS bunch length is ~1 nsec
It's a bit complicated because of the slip-stacking
