%% Text of abstract
New advances in photodetector technology may enable the detailed resolution of energy and flavor substructure in neutrino beams. A number of notable analyses by the MINOS and MiniBooNE collaborations have  looked at detailed features in the arrival time of neutrino bunches. Pushing that capability to finer time scales would allow selecting different neutrino energy and flavor spectra based on the arrival time of the neutrinos relative to the parent proton bunch time. Later neutrinos correspond to slower, and therefore lower energy, parent hadrons. In addition the fractions of tau, muon, and electron neutrinos (antineutrinos) varies with the arrival time. We show that these effects could be resolved by detectors with order 100 psec vertex time resolution, but that the discrimination is limited by the current bunch size of the protons impinging on the target. Shortening the width of neutrino bunches to well below 500 psec would substantially enhance this effect. As opposed to off-axis experiments, which  can only sample a small slice of the angular flux spectrum, this `stroboscopic' approach is analogous to sampling multiple off-axis angles with on-axis detectors, and is applied equally to both near and far detectors in an oscillation experiment.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The discovery of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in the neutrino sector hinges on high precision, increasingly systematics-dominated measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters. The dominant systematic uncertainties...

The wide span of energies in neutrino beams stems from the wide range of energies among the parent hadrons and is limited by the ability to cool and focus those beams. One handle for controlling and understanding the beam flux is to look at angles off-axis from the pointing of the beam, a technique notably exploited by the NOvA and T2K experiments.

Another handle for understanding and selecting different energy spectra within a neutrino beam exploits the differing velocities of the parent hadrons. Lower energy pions and kaons travel more slowly, especially as they approach sub-relativistic energies. As a consequence, lower energy neutrinos start further behind the rest of the bunch and selecting later arriving neutrinos would provide an increasingly pure low-energy subset of the overall flux.

The idea of using timing to resolve beam structure has a long history. Efforts to detect dark matter have relied on time-of-flight differences between dark matter particles and neutrinos. Timing has successfully been employed to identify a pure sample of stopped kaons and pions in neutrino beams. Several notable efforts have utilized bunch timing to place limits on neutrino velocity. MINOS, in particular, noted interesting kinematic relationships within the beam time. The MiniBooNE collaboration even explored the idea of using timing to select on the neutrino energy spectrum. However, efforts to select different energy spectra on the basis of beam timing have been largely overlooked due to two considerations: (1) Limited time resolutions of the detectors themselves were insufficient to see the O(100) psec effect, and (2) the $\sim$900 psec spread of the proton bunch impinging on the target washes out most of the effect.

In this paper, we revisit the idea of using beam timing to select different energy components of the neutrino flux. We show that existing precision timing technology is capable of resolving O(100) psec time-of-flight differences in neutrinos arrival times. {\it More importantly, we argue that feasible modifications to existing proton beams could superimpose a hyper-fine bunch structure on the protons, providing short enough bunches, spaced widely enough to fully exploit the energy spreading effect.}

The power of this technique stems from the fact that, in contrast to off-axis measurements, the different neutrino energy spectra can be selected within the same detector. Moreover, these timing relationships can be applied in near and far detector alike.

\section{The Mechanism}

The difference in arrival time of a neutrino from a sub-relativistic pion of energy E' with respect to a high energy pion travelling with speed $\sim$c is given by:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \frac{c - v(E')}{c} \tau (E')
\end{equation}

Where $\tau (E')$ is the lifetime of the lower energy pion in the lab frame. The time spreading will only occur until the decay of the lower energy pion, at which point the daughter neutrinos will propagate at c. The lifetime of the higher energy pion is irrelevant, since the pion is already propagating at roughly c.

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \tau (E') [1 - \beta (E')]
\end{equation}

Rewriting in terms of the pion lifetime in the restframe, $\tau_0$, we get:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = (\frac{E'}{m} \tau_0) [1 - \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{m^2}{E'^2}}]
\end{equation}

Regrouping the equation, we get the relationship:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = [\frac{E'}{m} - [1 - \sqrt{ \frac{E'^2}{m^2} - 1}] \tau_0
\label{eq:beamkinematicsandtiming}
\end{equation}

As one would expect, at the lowest energies, where the pion is essentially at rest in the lab frame, $\Delta t(E')$ approaches the lifetime of the pion in the rest frame, $\tau_0$. At high energies, the speed of the lower-energy pion approaches that of the higher energy pion and thus $\Delta t(E')$ goes to zero. 

Figure~\ref{fig:beamkinematicsandtiming} shows a plot of equation~\ref{eq:beamkinematicsandtiming} (TOP), and the simulated relationship between $\Delta t(E')$ and E' for the DUNE beam.
