%% Text of abstract
We propose to use a higher-frequency RF structure and a small array of
photodetectors with time resolution of order 10-20 psec for muon
monitoring downstream of the decay volume to correlate neutrino interactions in both near and far on-axis detectors with the
energy and flavor of each event. Analyses by the MINOS and MiniBooNE
collaborations have previously looked at detailed features in the
arrival time of neutrino bunches. Improving the capability to time
scales of order 100 psec would allow selecting different neutrino
energy and flavor spectra based on the arrival time of the neutrinos
relative to the parent proton bunch time. Later neutrinos correspond
to slower, and therefore lower energy, parent hadrons. In addition the
fractions of tau, muon, and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos
varies with the arrival time. The discrimination is currently limited
by the bunch size of the protons impinging on the target.  We show
that these effects can be resolved by measuring the pulse shape of
each proton bunch using muon beam monitors with order 10-20 psec time
resolution, and correlating the shape of each bunch with the localized
wave front of the corresponding neutrinos as they traverse the
detectors.  As opposed to off-axis experiments, which can only sample
a small slice of the angular flux spectrum, this `stroboscopic'
approach is analogous to sampling multiple off-axis angles with
on-axis detectors, and applies equally to both near and far detectors
in an oscillation experiment.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A deeper understanding of the neutrino sector, including CP violation,
the mass hierarchy, and deviations from unitarity of the PMNS matrix,
hinges on high precision, increasingly systematics-dominated
measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters. One approach to
reducing the systematic uncertainties is by expanding the range of L/E
and the mix of lepton family contributions measured {\it
  simultaneously} in both near and far detectors. Here we present a
scheme for such measurements at Fermilab using the
time-of-arrival of on-axis neutrinos at the near and far detectors relative to
the proton RF structure.

The wide span of energies in neutrino beams stems from the wide range
of energies of the parent hadrons.  A current technique for optimizing
the neutrino energy spectrum for measuring oscillations at a given
detector distance is to look at angles off-axis from the pointing of
the beam, a technique notably exploited by the NOvA and T2K
experiments.
% Matt is this correct?

An alternative method for understanding and selecting different energy
spectra within a neutrino beam exploits the differing velocities of
the parent hadrons. Lower energy pions and kaons travel more slowly,
especially as they approach sub-relativistic energies. As a
consequence, lower energy neutrinos are created further behind the rest of
the bunch and selecting later arriving neutrinos would provide an
increasingly pure low-energy subset of the overall flux (as shown
below, the time difference from hadron travel outweighs the compensating
effect that higher energy hadrons live longer.)

The idea of using timing to resolve beam structure has a long
history. Efforts to detect dark matter have relied on time-of-flight
differences between dark matter particles and neutrinos. Timing has
successfully been employed to identify a pure sample of stopped kaons
and pions in neutrino beams. Several notable efforts have utilized
bunch timing to place limits on neutrino velocity. MINOS, in
particular, noted interesting kinematic relationships within the beam
time. 

The MiniBooNE collaboration has recently explored the idea of using
timing relative to the RF structure of the proton beam 
to select on the neutrino energy spectrum. However, efforts to
select different energy spectra on the basis of beam timing have been
largely overlooked due to two considerations: (1) Limited time
resolutions of the detectors themselves were insufficient to see the
O(100) psec effect, and (2) the $\sim$900 psec spread of the proton
bunch impinging on the target washes out most of the effect. We
address both these issues below.

\subsection{Using Higher Frequency Accelerator RF for Energy and Flavor On-Axis
  Spectral Analysis}

Here we revisit the idea of using beam timing to select different
energy components of the neutrino flux, but with a higher-frequency RF
structure superimposed on the proton beam after normal acceleration
but before extraction. Additionally, we propose that the delay of each
event with respect to the proton bunch structure is reconstructed from
the position of the event vertex in the near and far detectors
relative to the 'zero time' of the RF clock as measured bunch-by-bunch
with muons from the proton target. Consequently good spatial
resolution at the detectors is a one-to-one proxy for time
measurement, enabling detectors such as DUNE or a new large liquid detector to 
use the technique without modification.
%The timing of the proton
%bunches is recorded bunch-by-bunch by a system of fast (10-20 psec)
%photodetectors detecting muons on and near axis downstream of the
%decay  volume.

\subsection{Organizational Outline}
An overview of the `stroboscopic' approach introduced above is
presented in Section~\ref{approach}. Section~\ref{Fermilab} describes
the outlines of a first implementation at Fermilab.
Section~\ref{mechanism} describes the mechanism of energy and flavor
separation by `time slicing' relative to the parent proton bunch
structure, and the impact of proton bunch size on the separation.
Section~\ref{time_sorted_spectra} presents energy spectra for
electron, muon, and tau neutrinos and anti-neutrinos for time windows
referenced to the their identified parent proton bunch.

Section~\ref{RF} addresses the accelerator and RF issues of re bunching
the protons at higher RF frequency, starting with the 53 MHz of the
Fermilab Main Injection. Bunch profiles are presented from simulations
of a 500 MHz Cornell RF cavity ramped up as the 53 MHz is ramped
down. Measuring the profile of each proton bunch relative to a precise
system clock using muons and a system of fast photodetectors is
described in Section~\ref{muon_monitor}.  Section~\ref{synchronization}
describes a scheme for synchronization of the intensity profile of the
parent proton with the time of a given neutrino
interaction. Section~\ref{results} summarizes the energy spectra for
electron, muon, and tau neutrinos and anti-neutrinos for the 500 MHz
beam profiles of Section~\ref{RF}. Conclusions and areas of needed
development  are presented in Section~\ref{conclusions}.

\section{The Stroboscopic Approach}
\label{approach}
We have dubbed the time-slicing of neutrino events relative to the
time of their parent bunch as a 'stroboscopic' approach, as it is
essentially successive snapshots of the neutrino bunch but with
different energy spectra and different neutrino family populations in
each time bin. We describe the basic ingredients of the technique
below.

\subsection{Timing Relative to Wave Fronts of Zero Time At the Detector}
\label{wave_front}

The RF structure of the proton beam at the neutrino target imprints
the interaction rate on the production of the hadrons that are the
primary source of neutrinos, as indicated in
Figure~\ref{fig:wave_fronts}. The spacing of the waves is given by the
period of the RF structure on the proton beam, $\tau$. The width of
the wave front depends on both the width of the proton bunch in the RF
bucket convoluted with the difference in time between the
production of the parent hadrons  at the target and their subsequent
decay that produces the neutrinos. An additional factor is the
different path lengths of the parent hadrons through the neutrino
focusing horn and decay region. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{center}
	\caption{A `snap-shot' of the neutrino wave-front moving
          through a neutrino detector.}

	\label{fig:wave_fronts}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Time Reference to Proton Bunch-by-Bunch Interaction
  Profiles at the Target}
\label{time_reference}

Figure~\ref{fig:bucket_timing} shows the time relationship between the
RF structure of the protons at the target and the neutrino events in a
detector at distance L from the target. The period of the RF is
denoted by $\tau$, and the FWHM of the proton bunch is denoted by
$\sigma_p$. Each neutrino bunch is offset to a later time from its
parent proton bunch by approximately $L/c$, where $c$ is the speed of
light.

The neutrinos from a given proton bunch arrive at the detector before
a signal can be transmitted using electromagnetism, i.e. real or
virtual photons. One consequently has to locally record the relevant
data on a bunch-to-bunch basis at the RF frequency. Each bunch should be
time stamped at both the target and the detector so that the data from
target and detector can be re-united
robustly. Section~\ref{muon_monitor} describes the muon monitor
systems that provide the data on the time profile of protons on target
for each bunch. Importantly, measuring the time of the neutrino events in the
detector, is not necessary, as described below in 
Section~\ref{position_as_proxy}.



\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
           	\includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{Figures/nupaper_timing_IMG_5836_crop.jpg}
	\end{center}
	\caption{A 'cartoon' of the correspondence bucket-by-bucket of
          the neutrino neutrino wave-front timing at the neutrino
          detector and the protons interacting with the target. The
          separation is given by the RF period $\tau$, and the FWHM of
        the proton bunch is denoted by $\sigma_p$.}
	\label{fig:bucket_timing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Neutrino Event Vertex Position as a Proxy for Time Measurement at Near or Far Detectors}
\label{position_as_proxy}

If the proton bucket width $\sigma_p$, is narrow, 
$\tau$, the neutrino `wave-front' has a well-defined position in the
detector, moving through the detector at velocity $c$. One
consequently can use the position of the event vertex as a proxy for
the time of the neutrino interaction (see
Figure~\ref{fig:wave_fronts}). Detectors with excellent vertex
resolution such as DUNE consequently need no additional timing
capabilities. 

\subsection{Energy and Flavor Spectra Sorted by Time Slice Relative to
the Parent Proton Bunch}
\label{spectra}


Figure~\ref{fig:wave_fronts} also indicates the `stroboscopic' nature
of this proposal. Neutrinos from lower energy hadron parents
(indicated in red) arrive in a distribution that tends 
later than neutrinos from higher energy
parents (indicated in blue), as described below in
Section~\ref{mechanism}. Time-slicing relative to the specific parent 
proton  bunch, i.e. on
a bunch-to-bunch basis, produces different energy spectra in each
time-slice. The spectra will also depend on the family type of the
neutrino, as electrons and muons are produced in different rations
from pions and kaons, and tau neutrinos, while rare, will be
predominantly produced by short-lived parents.

We propose that modifications to the Fermilab Main Injector could
superimpose a hyper-fine bunch structure on the protons, providing
short enough bunches, spaced widely enough to fully exploit the energy
spreading effect. No time measurement is necessary at the neutrino
detectors.

\section{The Mechanism of Energy and Flavor Separation By Time-of-Arrival}
\label{mechanism}

The power of this technique stems from the fact that, in contrast to
off-axis measurements, the different neutrino energy spectra can be
selected within the same detector. Moreover, these timing
relationships can be applied in near and far detector alike. 

We emphasize that the time of individual neutrino events is determined
by the position of the vertex with respect to the phase of the RF, and
requires no time measurement capability in the detector
itself. Instead, the RF
structure is measured bunch-by-bunch by a 10-15 GHz waveform sampling
system by the muon monitor system (MMS). The recorded stream of bunch 
structure parameters or profiles is time-stamped and synchronized with
the detector data as a separate operation.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Derivation of Time Dispersion}

The difference in arrival time of a neutrino from a sub-relativistic
pion of energy E' with respect to a high energy pion traveling with
speed $\sim$c is given by:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \frac{c - v(E')}{c} \tau (E')
\end{equation}

Where $\tau (E')$ is the lifetime of the lower energy pion in the lab
frame. The time spreading will only occur until the decay of the lower
energy pion, at which point the daughter neutrinos will propagate at
c. The lifetime of the higher energy pion is irrelevant, since the
pion is already propagating at roughly c.

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \tau (E') [1 - \beta (E')]
\end{equation}

Rewriting in terms of the pion lifetime in the restframe, $\tau_0$, we get:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \left(\frac{E'}{m} \tau_0\right) \left[1 - \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{m^2}{E'^2}} \right] 
\end{equation}

Regrouping the equation, we get the relationship:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t(E') = \left[\frac{E'}{m} - \sqrt{ \frac{E'^2}{m^2} - 1}\right] \tau_0
\label{eq:beamkinematicsandtiming}
\end{equation}

As one would expect, at the lowest energies, where the pion is
essentially at rest in the lab frame, $\Delta t(E')$ approaches the
lifetime of the pion in the rest frame, $\tau_0$. At high energies,
the speed of the lower-energy pion approaches that of the higher
energy pion and thus $\Delta t(E')$ goes to zero.

Figure~\ref{fig:beamkinematicsandtiming} shows a plot of
equation~\ref{eq:beamkinematicsandtiming} (TOP), and the simulated
relationship between $\Delta t(E')$ and E' for the DUNE beam.
