# BeamTimingAnalysis

## November 1, 2018: Meeting with Henry, Evan, Bernhard, and

Main injector is 7 times the Booster diameter, but only 6 of the 7 slots are taken. This is to give time to fire the kicker.

"Front Porch": acceleration of the beam (takes about a second) (batches are already in the recycler)

* 11 usec kicker time, every 1.2 seconds. Important figure of merit for all experiments.
* Contains 588 bunches (-84), spaced by an RF frequency of 53 MHz
* 500/53MHz give you 10 usec
* There is also slip-stacking (doubling up on the bunches)

(Booster Batch is at 50 MHz, 84 bunches)

On average the RMS bunch length is ~1 nsec
It's a bit complicated because of the slip-stacking
Bunches are spaced 20 nsec apart in each bucket

Need to rebunch fast so as not to expand the plateau...

Superconducting cavity - large aperture (commercially available)
you can buy it

9-10-11 harmonic

~$2M for a single cavity
MI-60
the fact that it's crygenic gives him pause
50 msec/1sec (5%) affect on the POT delivered
Don't need to go into engineering details to build a cavity
400 psec, RMS closer to 100 psec
