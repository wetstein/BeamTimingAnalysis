### June 3 2018 figures

Booster Neutrino Beam fluxes with time cuts.

### October 10 2018 figures

These were produced with the outputs from running the dk2nuTree script on 67 LBNF neutrino-mode flux files:
118,140,141,143-164,170-209,250

The DUNEbeam plots show the energy spectrum at different time cuts:
* red:            inclusive
* orange:         dT > 100 psec
* yellow:         dT > 250 psec
* light orange:   dT>500 psec
* beige-yellow:   dT>750 psec

Each file corresponds to a different time smearing on the width of the beam:
true timing, 100 psec Gaussian smearing, 250 psec smearing, 500 psec smearing, 900 psec smearing (close to real life)

time_numu_antinumu_nue shows the arrival time distribution (true timing) for the neutrinos of different flavors.
* thick black line:  inclusive
* purple:            numu
* green:             numu_bar
* light blue:        nue

time_pion_wrongsignpi(blue)kaon(green) shows the arrival time distribution (true timing) for the different Nprongparents
* thick black line:  inclusive
* purple:            pi+
* light blue:        pi-
* green:             K+

### October 14 2018 figures

2D temperature plots of parent hadron energy versus neutrino arrival time and neutrino energy versus neutrino
arrival time.

### November 7 2018 figures

RHCbeamcontent: The arrival time distribution of the neutrino beam (dark blue line), overlaid with the arrival time
distribution of the anti-neutrinos (blue shaded) and the arrival time distribution of neutrino contamination (red).

RHCbeamcontent_log: same plot, but on a log scale

RHCbeamE: The RHC beam energy spectrum for antineutrinos (blue) and neutrinos (red)

RHCbeamE_100psec_cut: same plot, but requiring neutrino arrival times after 100 psec

RHCbeamE_200psec_cut: same plot, but requiring neutrino arrival times after 200 psec
